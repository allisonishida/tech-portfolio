I am a Software Developer at IBM working in the IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management. I am currently located in Austin, TX and originally from the Bay Area, CA. I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley and eager to continue learning and developing my technical skills. I love all things dogs, food, and spending time with family and friends.
